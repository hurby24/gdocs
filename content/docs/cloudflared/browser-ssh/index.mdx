<Callout>This setup requires a running Cloudflare Tunnel instance.</Callout>

## Pre-Setup: Configuring SSH in Cloudflare Tunnel

Before adding the application, we need to configure the Cloudflare Tunnel to allow SSH access.

1. **Edit your Cloudflare Tunnel configuration file** (typically `config.yml`):

   ```yaml title="config.yml"
   tunnel: <your-tunnel-id>
   credentials-file: /path/to/<your-tunnel-id>.json

   ingress:
     - hostname: ssh.example.com
       service: tcp://localhost:22
     - service: http_status:404
   ```

   Replace `<your-tunnel-id>` with your actual Cloudflare Tunnel ID and `ssh.example.com` with your desired SSH subdomain.

   <Callout>
     {" "}
     Don't forget to restart the Cloudflare Tunnel after editing the configuration
     file and add the CNAME record in your DNS provider to ensure proper connectivity.
   </Callout>

## Adding an Application

To enable SSH access via the browser, we need to configure an application in Cloudflare Zero Trust.

1. **Navigate to the Cloudflare Dashboard:**
   - Go to **Zero Trust** > **Access** > **Applications**.
2. **Add a new application:**

   - Click on **Add an application**.
   - In the configuration settings, specify the **hostname** (the subdomain where your tunnel points to SSH).
   - Configure access **policies** if needed.

3. **Enable Browser SSH Rendering:**
   - Under **Advanced Settings**, enable **Browser Rendering**.
   - Choose **SSH** as the application type.

Once configured, users can securely access the SSH terminal directly from their browser using Cloudflare's authentication and access control mechanisms.
